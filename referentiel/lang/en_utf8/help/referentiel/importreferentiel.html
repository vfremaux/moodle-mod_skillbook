<h1>Import a skills repository</h1>

<p> If you have a repository backup in XML format (produced
   by the export function) you can restore it
   in your Moodle course.</P>
<p>Then, two situations can occur:</P>
<ul>
  <li> This is a new skills repository for this Moodle space; it becomes available
     for this (<em>local </em>!= 0) course or for all the (<em>local</em> 
    == 0) courses;</li>
  <li>If there is an identical local version (same name, same code) – the skills repository 
    is already existing in Moodle: 
    <ul>
      <li> If you choose to overwrite the existing version, it will be replaced by the imported version;</li>
      <li>If you choose to keep the existing version; the import process will be canceled;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
