<h1>Certificates</h1>
<p>The certification is the process where skills are declared, assessed, validated.
<br>
Whether or not a formal certification takes place, 
the approach is to assess knowledge and skills, job skills, 
abilities using a multi criteria scale.<br> The certificate provides an instant view of 
the students’ progress in the certification process. 
<br>
And finally the certificate can produce an &quot;official document&quot that the student is awarded
at the end of his learning pathways.
</p>
<p>A certificate contains:
<ul>
<li>A skills list validated for the related repository; </li>
<li>The reference of the teacher who validated the certificate; </li>
<li>The date and the decision of the committee regarding the certification; </li>
<li>Optionnaly the student may draft a synthesis and the teacher a commentary; </li>
</ul>

<p>When a certificate is locked (list of skills on pink background)
no skills cannot be added, the student’s file is considered as closed. </p>

<h3>Certificate validation</h3>
<p>Fingerprint null does not count for certification.</p>
<p>Only Items which are validated in activities more times than their fingerprint count for certification.</p>

<h3>Grades</h3>
<p>How much a student is far of gettig a certificate is displayed by percentages.</p>
<ul>
<li>At Item level :<br>100% * NUMBER_VALIDATED_ITEM / FINGERPRINT_ITEM</li>
<li>At skill level  :<br>100 * SUM_ITEMS_SKILL(NUMBER_VALIDATED_ITEM / WEIGHT_ITEM) / SUM_ITEMS_SKILL(WEIGHT_ITEM * FINGERPRINT_ITEM)</li>
<li>Au niveau du domaine :<br>100% * SUM_ITEMS_DOMAIN(NUMBER_VALIDATED_ITEM / WEIGHT_ITEM) / SUM_ITEMS_DOMAIN(WEIGHT_ITEM * FINGERPRINT_ITEM)</li>
</ul>
<p>The contribution of an Item to the skill or domain grade is proportionnal with WEIGHT * FINGERPRINT.</p>
