<h1>Activities</h1>
<p>Rather than declare skills item by item
 the student may check its expertise by reporting <em>activities</em>.
</p>
<p>An activity:
<ul>
<li>is a declarative part written by the student; </li>
<li>concerns an instance of a skills repository (<i>it <b>contains</b> a skills list of this repository</i>); </li>
<li>is linked to a course; </li>
</ul>

<p>An unlimited number of documents can be linked to an activity.</p>
<p>To ensure that skills declared in an activity are taken into account for the certification
this activity must be validated by a teacher.</p>
