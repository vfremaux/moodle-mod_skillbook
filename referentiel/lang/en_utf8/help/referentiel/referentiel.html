<h1>Skills Repositories</h1>

<p>A skills repository is a hierarchy of objects:<br />
  <pre>
Repository  
   Domain 1 (Code, Description)
      Skill 1.1 (Code, Description)
         Item 1.1.1 (Code, Description, Weight)
         Item 1.1.2 (Code, Description, Weight)
      Skill 1.2 (Code, Description)
         Item 1.2.1 (Code, Description, Weight)
         Item 1.2.2 (Code, Description, Weight)
         Item 1.2.3 (Code, Description, Weight)					 
   Domain 2 (Code, Description)
      Skill 2.1 (Code, Description)
         Item 2.1.1 (Code, Description, Weight)
         Item 2.1.2 (Code, Description, Weight)
...
