<h1>Skills Repositories</h1>

<h2>Repository Instance</h2>
<p>A repository instance is an activity within the Moodle meaning (as are
   "Assignment", "Forum" or "Lesson") based on a repository, and allows
   students:</p>
<p><ul>- to declare the activities involving skills in the repository; <br>
  - to check these skills; </ul></p>
<p> and allows teachers to assess these skills...</p>
<p> When creating a new instance (it can coexist more than one
   in the same course, whether pointing to the same repository or to 
   different ones) the following must be defined:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Instance Title</strong> [<em>mandatory</em>]: This is the name
     under which this instance appears to be an integrated activity in
     a course ...
  </li>
  <li><strong>Instance Description</strong> [<em>optional</em>]: Short note to inform students about the objectives of this activity.
  </li>
  <li><strong> How should we call a domain?</strong> [<em>optional</em>]: For displays, which label identifies the concept of the &quot;domain&quot;.
  </li>
  <li><strong>How should we call a skill?</strong>: For displays, 
    which label identifies the concept of the &quot;skill&quot;.
  </li>
  <li><strong> How should we call an item?</strong>: For displays, 
    which label identifies the concept of the &quot;item&quot;.</li>
</ul>
You can too set configuration parameters at instance level in respect of parameters set by admin at site level.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Configuration</strong> : Acces to scolarship data and import, modification of repository and certificate printing authorisations.</li>
  <li><strong>Certificate prints</strong> : Kind of data to print in certificates.</li>
</ul>
