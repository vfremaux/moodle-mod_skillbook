<h1>Coaching and notification</h1> 
<h2>Accompaniment</h2> 
<p>The accompaniment is to designate one or more teachers next to each student's progress. 
By doing so you share the burden of tracking students. 
</p>
<p>This affects in particular the notification of new activities. 
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the assignment of a referee to a student does not prevent other teachers of the course to see the statements of the student and possibly evaluate. 
</p>
<h2>
Notification 
</h2>
<p>Notification is to send an email containing the substance of activities or tasks of a user, 
on the model of what is convenient for viewing a forum Moodle. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Notification of <em>Activities</em> 
<br />
The creator of an activity must explicitly request the notification of it by checking a button before saving the task. 
<br />
<ul>
<li>If referees are assigned to the student, they alone will receive notifications of new activities declared by him;</li> 
<li>If not any referee is assigned to the student, any notification of a new activity will be sent to all teachers of the course; </li>
</ul>
<br />
</li>
<li>Notification of <em>Tasks</em>
<br />The creator of a task can notify it to all teachers and all students of the course. 
<br /></li>
<li>Notification of Certificates
<br />When modificating a certificate (for comment or lock, for example) the teacher can notify his certificate to the student.</li>
