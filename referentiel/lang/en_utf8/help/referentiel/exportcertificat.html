<h1>Export certificates</h1>

<p>To export certificates of a repository you have to choose between two formats:
<ul>
<li>The XML format to backup and subsequently restore; </li>
<li>The XHTML format to get a file that appears as a Web page.</li>
</ul>
<p>The files exported by the module repository are placed in the data folder &quot;\referentiel&quot; of the corresponding course (to be found in the \moodledata directory of the Moodle site).</P>
