<h1>Export of certificates</h1>>
<h2>Exported data</h2>
<p>
The export of certificates is intended for the filing or for the transfer towards services of schooling.
<br />Two sizes(formats) are available
<ol><li>Complete size(format): all the data are exported</li>
<li>Condensed size(format): the identifier, the name, the first name and the percentages of validated skills are exported, what is generally enough for the services of schooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>To select the data to be handled it is rather advisable to pass by the tab "Print".</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>The administrators can export all the certificates corresponding to a given reference table.
<br />
The teachers with editing right can export only students' certificates of the course.
</p>
<h2>Formats of export of certificates</h2>
<ul>
<li>XML is a textual data format representing the information as a tag hierarchies and nested data.
 It allows the backup and restore of skills repositories, activities and certificates.
 <br>

</li>


<li>The XHTML format is an export-type format intended for Web page display.
<br /><br />
</li>
<li> The CSV is a textual format of tabular data (like in a spreadsheet).<br>
  The CSV uses a separator, in general ';' between the cells of a table.<br>
   <br />
The CSV is not really suited for nested data, as in a skills repository.
  </li>
</ul>
