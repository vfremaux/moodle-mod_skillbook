<h1>Tasks</h1>

<p><b><i>Tasks</i></b> are achievements or activities offered by teachers to students in their courses.
<br />Tasks for teachers are somehow the opposite view of activities for students.</p>
<p>
Only the teachers can suggest tasks. 
<br />Students can subscribe to tasks. In doing so, from the task subscribed new activities are automatically added to the student Activity thumb... 
</p><p>The validation process of a task is to spread skills by pointing it. 
In this way the skills associated with a task are recorded for the certification of student applicants.
